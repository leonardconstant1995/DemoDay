# DuoExchange
App currently in creation. This app will have login capabilities. Users will be able to sign in and chat with native speakers of their target languages. Chat will run through video chat and a text chat for people to communicate if they would like to practice typing their target language instead of speaking.

Link to project: N/A yet


## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Socket.io

So far in the development process we are utilzing Javascript and socket.io to allow low latency communication between two computers. Also creating a room and giving each room a unique Id for people to join into.

## Lessons Learned: 
Seems like adding video components was a bit adventurous. Ran through a good amount of road blocks so far with being able to connect on video from two different computers.
